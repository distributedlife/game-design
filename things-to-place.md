Elements
- frame advantage - so can perform their next action before you
- momentum advantage - because the natural response is to respond to them
- positional advantage - In that they have decided where you and they will be
- tradeable resources
 - Metro uses ammo as the currency. So shooting a lot is expensive in that regard.

Mechanics
- initiative
 - Initiative being the person who is able to pick the available options for the players in the next round

Plays
- Regaining Initiative
 - a jab (higher priority, low risk, low reward) vs. strong attack (lower priority, higher risk, high reward) - use to break priority
 - a counter (lower priority, high risk, high reward) - guess someone's move and therefore get advantage

Human Element
-Versus games - managing risk is a big factor
-Prediction vs. Pattern Matching
-Composure / countenance (coolness under pressure)

Games
- anonymous games (composure / countenance is not so important)
- random games (composure / countenance is not so important)



### Damage reduces effectiveness
This isn't a damage model. The model is none, limited or full recovery. What this is, is the impact of resource depletion. It could be fuel. The less fuel you have it reduces your effectiveness (you can waste fuel) and if you run out you lose. It could be damage to your vehicle/body. The fewer resource points you have the slower you move.

TODO: Find a home for this.

###### Examples
- [F1](/games/f1)
-  Gabe from penny arcades card game had a similar mechanic. If you were wounded or cursed you'd get that card in your deck. If you have more wound cards in your hand than your Constitution (or whatever) then you died.
-  Curse cards from dominion.



## Idea - unreleated to damage reduces effectiveness
### Health as a tradable resources
Health is not often considered a [tradeable resource](/examples/tradeable-resource). But it is possible to trade health for something like a [positional advantage](/elements/position-advantage). Or, in a card game the player might be able to discard reflex cards (to get out of the way) or shield cards (to block the attack) but if neither are available or the player values them more then health cards can be discarded (accepting the hit).


It'd be interesting tying the health mechanic to other things too. Like currency, or NPC interactions.
Or stealth. Maybe it's harder to blend into the crowd and seem like a bystander if you've clearly had the fuck kicked out of you
