Pid is a game that uses counterattacks to increase difficulty. The game starts off with **No ability to counterattack** where normal opponents have to be defeated by direct attacks. The first mini boss, the dog toy, can have it's missiles turned back on itself. This is **Counterattacking is equally effective to direct attacks** before the larger bosses are **Only counterattacks are effective** and Pid has to get the boss to start his attack before Pid can get close enough to attack.
