### [Counterattacks](/elements/counterattack)
Pid is a game that uses counterattacks to increase difficulty. The game starts off with **No ability to counterattack** where normal opponents have to be defeated by direct attacks. The first mini boss, the dog toy, can have it's missiles turned back on itself. This is **Counterattacking is equally effective to direct attacks** before the larger bosses are **Only counterattacks are effective** and Pid has to get the boss to start his attack before Pid can get close enough to attack.

### [Defence](/elements/defence)
The player in Pid can hide behind parts of the world. This act of defence is more of a pacing mechanic than a defence mechanic. **defence has limited effect; favour direct attack** as the player waits until they are ready to attempt the next move, direct attacking as required. 

There is one variation on this where the floating blue balls cannot be killed and the player has to use the world to block the site of the opponent. Here the game takes on a **no attacks are possible; only defence exists** aspect.
