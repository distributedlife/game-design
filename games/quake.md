### [Counterattacks](/elements/counterattack)
In quake, like many first person shooters, the player has **no ability to counterattack**. The main approach from the player is to hide or avoid attacks from their opponents whilst launching their own.

### [Defence](/elements/defence)
The player in Quake can hide behind parts of the world. This means **defence has limited effect; favour direct attack** as the player waits until it is safe before stepping out to make their attack.
