### [Counterattacks](/elements#Counterattacks)
This element ties into the core theme of missile command. Survival of a nuclear war isn't possible; it's just a matter of time before you lose. **Only counterattacks are effective** as the player can shoot down incoming missiles but cannot launch their own attack. It's futile and one can only counter for so long.

TODO: or is this defence?
