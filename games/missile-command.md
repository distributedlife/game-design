## Game Elements
### [Counterattacks](/elements#Counterattacks)
This element ties into the core theme of missile command. Survival of a nuclear war isn't possible; **Attacking is not an element of this game** it's just a matter of time before you lose.

### [Defence](/elements#Defence)
This element ties into the core theme of missile command. Survival of a nuclear war isn't possible; it's just a matter of time before you lose. **No attacks are possible; only defence exists** as the player can shoot down incoming missiles but cannot launch their own attack. It's futile and one can only defend for so long.
