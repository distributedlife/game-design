### Counterattacks: the player can only deal damage through counterattack

This element ties into the core theme of missile command. Survival of a nuclear war isn't possible; it's just a matter of time before you lose. The player can shoot down incoming missiles but cannot launch their own attack. It's futile and the only option.
