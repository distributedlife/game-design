## Defence
How important is element of defence in the game. Defence can be defined as the trading away of initiative in order to reduce damage or increase time. Defence could be through action (block, avoidance or shooting down an attack), through equipment (a shield) or the environment (cover). How the defence is achieved is not important; it is more how effective it is and how often it must be employed.

There are five points along this spectrum:

- No defence
- Defence has limited effect; favour direct attack
- The player must mix defence and attack equally
- Attacks are best made through the cover of defence
- All attacks should be made from defence
- No attacks are possible; only defence exists

The effectiveness of defence is not necessarily related to the damage stopped. Effective defence could increase the speed of a counterattack, increase the player's attack damage or allow for a safe retreat.

### No defence
The player is unable to defend and any successful attacks reduce the player's health.

###### Examples
- [Loneliness](/games/loneliness)
- [Missile Command](/games/missile-command)

### Defence has limited effect; favour direct attack
Any defence mechanic where the player is still better of engaging in a direct attack is ineffective. An example may that the game provides cover for the player to hide from opponents but the player has to leave the safety of cover and engage in direct attacks to progress.

###### Examples
- [Pid](/games/pid) - Using the environment to hide out of range of simple opponents
- [Quake](/games/quake) - Using the environment to hide out of range of opponents
- [Mortal Combat](/games/mortal-combat)

### The player must mix defence and attack equally
This type of game has the player engaging in pure defence and puer attack modes. A fighting game where the player has to block incoming attacks

###### Examples
- [Street Fighter](/games/street-fighter)
- [Tekken](/games/tekken)
- [Dead or Alive](/games/dead-or-alive)

### Attacks are best made through the cover of defence
A player spends a large proportion of time engaged in defence. It is only at opportune times do they leave defence to attack. These games are sometimes known as '*cover-shooters*'

###### Examples
- [Gears of War 2](/games/gears-of-war-2) - A player spends plenty of time hiding behind cover before popping out to make a shot on their opponent.

### All attacks should be made from defence
Every attack has to be launched from defence. Attacking directly would either result in an unwinnable situation or is not possible within the game.

###### Examples
- None yet.

### No attacks are possible; only defence exists
The players only hope is to neutralise attacks or to have sufficient cover to resist the attacks.

###### Examples
- [Missile Command](/games/missile-command) - the player can only shoot down incoming missiles. The player has no ability to launch an attack of their own.
- [Pid](/games/pid) - The floating blue balls can't be defeated. The player has to use the environment for cover.
