# Defence
How important is element of defence in the game. Defence in some cases be defined as the trading away of initiative in order to reduce resource loss (i.e. damage) or to increase time. Defence in stronger forms yield initiative aganist direct attacks and in a weaker form provides no advantage to subsequent attacks.

Defence could be through action (block, avoidance or shooting down an attack), through equipment (a shield) or the environment (cover). How the defence is achieved is not important; what is, is how effective defence is and how often it must be employed to be successful.

There are five points along this spectrum:

- No defence
- Defence has limited effect; favour direct attack
- The player must mix defence and attack equally
- Attacks are best made through the cover of defence
- All attacks should be made from defence
- No attacks are possible; only defence exists

The effectiveness of defence is not necessarily related to the damage stopped. Effective defence could increase the speed of a counterattack, increase the player's attack damage or allow for a safe retreat.

### No defence
The player is unable to defend and any successful attacks reduce the player's effectiveness or some resource i.e. health.

###### Examples
- [Loneliness](/games/loneliness) - the concept of attacking does not exist in this game.

### Defence has limited effect; favour direct attack
Any defence mechanic where the player is still better off engaging in a direct attack, has limited effectiveness. An example may that the game provides cover for the player to hide from opponents but the player has to leave the safety of cover and engage in direct attacks to progress. In this example being behind cover &mdash;in defence&mdash; yields no benefit to the attack.

###### Examples
- [Pid](/games/pid) - Using the environment to hide out of range of simple opponents
- [Quake](/games/quake) - Using the environment to hide out of range of opponents

### The player must mix defence and attack equally
This type of game has the player mixing attack and defence modes. This position the spectrum indicates that neither attack or defence is the best strategy just that both must be used in order to win an evenly matched game.

###### Examples
- [Mortal Kombat](/games/mortal-kombat) - *TODO: need more info*
- [Street Fighter](/games/street-fighter) - *TODO: need more info*
- [Tekken](/games/tekken) - *TODO: need more info*
- [Dead or Alive](/games/dead-or-alive) - *TODO: need more info*

### Attacks are best made through the cover of defence
A player spends a large proportion of time engaged in defence. It is only at opportune times do they leave defence to attack. First person shooter games with this element are sometimes known as '*cover-shooters*'

###### Examples
- [Gears of War 2](/games/gears-of-war-2) - A player spends plenty of time hiding behind cover before popping out to make a shot on their opponent.

### All attacks should be made from defence
Every attack has to be launched from defence. Attacking directly would either result in an unwinnable situation or is not possible within the game.

###### Examples
- None yet.

### No attacks are possible; only defence exists
The players only hope is to neutralise attacks or to have sufficient cover to resist the attacks.

###### Examples
- [Missile Command](/games/missile-command) - the player can only shoot down incoming missiles. The player has no ability to launch an attack of their own.
- [Pid](/games/pid) - The floating blue balls can't be defeated. The player has to use the environment for cover.

## Ideas
*TODO: We might need a better home for these.*

### Progressing from one end to the other
Consider a game where the player starts off with **no attacks are possible; only defence exists** but as the game progresses and they master defence options for attacking exist. The player would progress from **all attacks should be made from defence** to **attacks are best made through the cover of defence** before reaching the halfway point **the player must mix defence and attack equally**. Then there is a shift where defence is no longer the best choice and attacking become crucial the player enters **defence has limited effect; favour direct attack** before finally being reduced to **no defence**. This could work in the other direction. 

### All attacks should be made from defence
Auto-defence exists for both players and, in conjunction with some other element like counter-attacking, players have to work out a to get the other player to expose themselves. A timer and draws result in both players losing could provide some extrinsic incentive to make an attack.
