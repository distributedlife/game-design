## Defence
How much emphasis is put on the need for a player to defend. Defence could be through action (block, avoidance or shooting down an attack), through equipment (a shield) or the environment (cover). How the defence is achieved is not important; more how effective it is and how often it must be employed. A counterattack (shooting down a missile) is not considered a defence.

There are five points along this spectrum:

- No defence
- Defence has limited effect; favour direct attack
- The player must mix defence and attack equally
- Attacks are best made through the cover of defence
- All attacks should be made from defence
- No attacks are possible; only defence exists

The effectiveness of defence is not necessarily related to the damage stopped. Effective defence could increase the speed of a counterattack, increase the player's attack damage or allow for a safe retreat.

### No defence
The player is unable to defend and any successful attacks reduce the player's health.

###### Examples
- [Loneliness](/games/loneliness)
- [Missile Command](/games/missile-command)

### Defence has limited effect; favour direct attack
Any defence mechanic where the player is still better of engaging in a direct attack is ineffective. An example may that the game provides cover for the player to hide from opponents but the player has to leave the safety of cover and engage in direct attacks to progress.

###### Examples
- [Pid](/games/pid)

### The player must mix defence and attack equally

### All attacks should be made from defence

### No attacks are possible; only defence exists
The players only hope is to neutralise attacks or to have sufficient cover to resist the attacks.

###### Examples
- [Missile Command](/games/missile-command) - the player can only shoot down incoming missiles. The player has no ability to launch an attack of their own.
- [Pid](/games/pid) - The floating blue balls can't be defeated. The player has to use the environment to provide cover.
