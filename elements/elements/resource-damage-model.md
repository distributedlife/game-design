#Resource Damage Model
A resource damage model is how the player's is able to deal with damage to a resource. The most common usage of this is the loss of health or armour. Both of which are just resources to be spent.

The following steps along the spectrum exist:
- Fixed number of units
- Limited recovery system
- Full recovery system
- Regeneration system
- Damage reduces effectiveness
- Invulnerability / No damage model

### Fixed number of units
The resource can sustain a number of hits before it has been completely depleted. A special case is when the number is one which results in a **touch is death** situation

####### Examples
- [Bit.TRIP Runner](/games/bit.trip-runner) - If the player touches any part of the world the run ends.
- [Missile Command](/games/missile-command) - Each of the cities the player must defend represent 'health'.
