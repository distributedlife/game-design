## Counterattacks
A counterattack is a tactic employed in response to an attack. The general objective is to negate or thwart the advantage gained by the enemy during attack, whilst the specific objectives typically seek to regain lost ground or destroy the attacking enemy &mdash; [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterattack).

There are six different points along this spectrum:

- Attacking is not an element of this game
- No ability to counterattack
- Counterattacking is ineffective; favour direct attacks
- Counterattacking is equally effective to direct attacks
- Counterattacking is favoured over direct attacks
- Only counterattacks are effective

Effectiveness does not always refer to damage caused. An ineffective attack might be one that wastes too much time or other resource.

### Attacking is not an element of this game.
This game does not feature combat in any form and therefore cannot include counterattacks.

###### Examples
- [Loneliness](/games/loneliness)
- [Missile Command](/games/missile-command)

### No ability to counterattack
The player is unable to counterattack. This means that attacks must either be avoided or defended against.

###### Examples
- [Pid](/games/pid) - Normal opponents have to be defeated by direct attacks
- [Quake](/games/quake) - All opponents

### Counterattacking is ineffective; favour attacking
The counterattack is either difficult to achieve or ineffective. A better approach for the player is to perform a direct attack.

###### Examples
- [XCOM Enemy Unknown](/games/xcom-enemy-unknown) - Terror Missions use a time limit to make counter attacks ineffective
- [Borderlands 2](/games/borderlands-2) - There are two useful strategies: kiting wildlife and goliaths. Both of these use the direct attack of opponents against their allies. The net result is a loss to the player as such a tactic results in fewer XP points gained and the player falls behind the game in level progression.

### Counterattacking is equally effective to direct attacks
Neither direct attack or counterattack will result in victory. The player must mix the two together.

###### Examples
- [XCOM Enemy Unknown](/games/xcom-enemy-unknown) - During the earlier stages of the game a mix of direct and counterattacks are required. Sometimes one or the other is forced
- [Pid](/games/pid) - The dog toy boss can have it's missiles turned back on itself.

### Favour counterattack based attacks
While the player can perform a direct attack it is often ineffective and therefore counterattacking is a preferred tactic.

###### Examples
- [XCOM Enemy Unknown](/games/xcom-enemy-unknown) - During the later stages of the game the aliens are so dangerous that direct attacks are ineffective.

### Only counterattacks are effective
These games have no direct attack element or any direct attack is doomed. You can't attack opponents unless they are attacking.

###### Examples
- [Pid](/games/pid) - Bosses - Pid has to get the boss to attack before Pid can get close enough to attack.
