## Counterattacks
A counterattack is a tactic employed in response to an attack. The general objective is to negate or thwart the advantage gained by the enemy during attack, whilst the specific objectives typically seek to regain lost ground or destroy the attacking enemy.[1]

### Attacking is not an element of this game.
This game does not feature combat in any form and therefore cannot include counterattacks.

#### Examples
- [Loneliness](http://www.necessarygames.com/my-games/loneliness)

### No ability to counterattack
The player is unable to counterattack. This means that attacks must either be avoided or defended against.

#### Examples
- Quake
- Many first person shooters

### Counterattacking has limited effect
### Counterattacking is weak; favour attacking
### Player must mix attack and counterattack equally
*TODO: Talk about how the player is forced into doing this*
#### Examples
- XCOM Enemy Unknown 

### Favour counterattack based attacks
### Direct attacks have limited effect

### The player can only deal damage through a counterattack
These games have no direct attack element. You can't attack the other player unless they are attacking. It could be the player's attack is a form of defence (Missile Command) or that the player's attack does damage to the core opponent and victory is possible (?).

#### Examples:
- Missile Command - the player can only shoot down incoming missiles. The player has no ability to launch an attack of their own.

## Game Elements
- Counterattacks - the player can only deal damage through counterattack
This element ties into the core theme of missile command. Survival of a nuclear war isn't possible; it's just a matter of time before you lose. The player can shoot down incoming missiles but cannot launch their own attack. It's futile and the only option.
