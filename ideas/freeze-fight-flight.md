# Freeze Fight Flight
The game resolves around the fear response and uses that as the core gameplay mechanic. The player when faced with danger has to apply one of the three responses or die.

The game will probable a puzzle style game.

An easy opponent can be avoided by using two of the three techniques.
A harder opponent can only be avoided by using the correct technique.

More complicated opponent should be designed to invoke the incorrect fear response e.g. brutes you have to fight or flying opponent where you have to flee.

Some opponents will cause a response, be neutral to another and defeated by the third.

No response should be more powerful than any other response.
