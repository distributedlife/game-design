# Freeze Fight Flight
The game resolves around the fear response and uses that as the core gameplay mechanic. The player when faced with danger has to apply one of the three responses or die.

The game will probable a puzzle style game.

An easy creature can be avoided by using two of the three techniques.
A harder creature can only be avoided by using the correct technique.

More complicated creatures should be designed to invoke the incorrect fear response e.g. brutes you have to fight or flying creatures where you have to flee.

No response should be more powerful than any other response.
